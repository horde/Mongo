# PHP 7/8 inspired todos

Horde_Mongo's original intent was to be both compatible with the "mongo" extension and the "mongodb" extension.
The older "mongo" extension is not available for PHP 7/8. Thus we will always use the compatibility layer.

- Use ext/mongodb extension natively
- remove dependency on external wrapper library
